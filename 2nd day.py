''' Difference between list and tuples 



List :
     it is define as "ORDER COLLECTION OF DATA/ ITEMS"
     . It is mutable(can be changed )
     .syntax []
     .slower due to flexibilty 
     . hold dynamic data 
     . example - my_list = ["apple",1,2]


Tuple:
    it is define as"ORDER DATA CANNOT  BE CHANGED "
    . It is immutable (can't be changed')
    .syntax ()
    . holds static data 
    .faster due to flexibility 
    .example - my_tuple=(1,2,"apple")
